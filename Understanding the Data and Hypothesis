## 🔬 Understanding the Data: Hypothesis Testing

To explore the potential relationship between a team's **Assist/Turnover (AST/TO) ratio** and their overall performance in the playoffs, I conducted a simple hypothesis test.

### 🎯 Research Question
Is there a statistically significant relationship between a team’s Assist/Turnover ratio and their:
- **Win Percentage**
- **Points Per Game**

### 🧪 Hypotheses
**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no relationship between AST/TO ratio and either win percentage or points per game.  
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a relationship between AST/TO ratio and at least one of the two: win percentage or points per game.

### 📊 Test Performed
I calculated the **Pearson correlation coefficient** between AST/TO ratio and:
- Win Percentage
- Points Per Game

The results showed:
- A **moderate positive correlation** between AST/TO and Points Per Game.
- A **weak or no significant correlation** between AST/TO and Win Percentage.

### 📌 Interpretation
These results suggest that teams with better assist/turnover ratios tend to score more, but that **does not always translate into more wins** in the playoffs. This partially supports the alternative hypothesis, particularly in relation to scoring.

However, due to the complexity of playoff basketball, other performance variables (e.g. defense, rebounding, pace, matchups) likely influence the outcome beyond assist efficiency.
