# üî¨ Playoff Data: Statistical Hypothesis Testing Results

## Hypothesis

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** Assist/Turnover (AST/TO) ratio has no relationship with Win Percentage and Points Per Game.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** Assist/Turnover (AST/TO) ratio is related to at least one of Win Percentage or Points Per Game.

---

## Statistical Test

We performed a Pearson correlation test on the playoff dataset to evaluate the relationship between AST/TO ratio and:
- **Points Per Game (PTS/Game)**
- **Win Percentage (Win%)**

### Results:

**AST/TO Ratio vs Points Per Game**
- Correlation coefficient (r) = **0.670**
- p-value = **1.06 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åµ**

**AST/TO Ratio vs Win Percentage**
- Correlation coefficient (r) = **0.247**
- p-value = **0.1519**

---

## Interpretation

- For **Points Per Game**:
  - Since p < 0.05, we **reject the null hypothesis**.
  - There is a **statistically significant positive relationship** between AST/TO ratio and Points Per Game.

- For **Win Percentage**:
  - Since p > 0.05, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**.
  - There is **no statistically significant relationship** between AST/TO ratio and Win Percentage.

## Conclusion

> The playoff data analysis shows that a better Assist/Turnover ratio tends to correlate with higher scoring averages, but does not consistently predict higher win rates.

Further, multivariate analysis could be conducted to account for additional factors such as defense, rebounding, and team matchups to understand playoff success more comprehensively.
