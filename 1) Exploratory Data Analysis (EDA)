# ðŸ”¢ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Datasets Overview

This analysis uses two datasets covering NBA team performance:

- **Regular Season Data (2000â€“2023):** Includes overall team statistics such as assists, turnovers, total points scored, and win rates over 23 seasons.
- **Playoff Data (2000â€“2021):** Contains similar metrics but under the heightened pressure and intensity of postseason competition.

Both datasets allow us to compare assist efficiency (Assist/Turnover Ratio) with team success indicators like Points and Win Percentage.

## 2. Key Metrics Analyzed

For each dataset, the following metrics were the focus:

- **Assists:** Average number of assists per game.
- **Turnovers:** Average number of turnovers per game.
- **Points:** Average points scored per game.
- **Win Percentage:** Ratio of wins to total games played.

---

## 3. Observations

- **Assists:**  
  Regular season teams averaged around **23â€“25 assists per game**, while playoff teams averaged slightly fewer, around **20 assists per game**.  
  This reflects the tighter defenses and slower pace typical of playoff basketball.

- **Turnovers:**  
  Turnovers remained relatively consistent between the two datasets, averaging **13â€“14 per game**.  
  Playoff games showed slightly better ball security in some cases, possibly due to the higher stakes.

- **Points:**  
  Regular season points per game averaged higher (**approximately 110 points**) compared to playoff points (**around 97 points**).  
  Again, this decrease supports the idea that playoff defenses are more intense and scoring is more difficult.

- **Win Percentage:**  
  Regular season win percentages naturally vary widely depending on the season, while playoff data mostly features teams that already achieved higher win rates.  
  However, significant variability still exists within playoff outcomes.

## 4. Initial Conclusions

- Teams generally experience **a drop in assist numbers and scoring** when moving from the regular season to playoffs, but **turnover rates stay relatively stable**.
- A high Assist/Turnover Ratio might positively impact Points Per Game more clearly in the regular season, while **in the playoffs**, other factors (defense, matchups, experience) could weaken this relationship.
- The preliminary findings suggest that **assist efficiency remains important**, but its direct connection to winning may diminish slightly under playoff conditions.

> This EDA sets the stage for deeper correlation analyses and hypothesis testing to more formally evaluate the impact of Assist/Turnover Ratio on team success.
