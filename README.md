# Heart Rate and Blood Oxygen Level Analysis

## Hello my name is Doruk Kocaman. My main goal is to examine the effects of my daily routines in a regular college term on my blood oxygen level and heart rate. After some examination I aim to find some causations or correlation between my health aspects and my daily activities. 

## Source and Purpose
This project aims to analyze the effects of different conditions (drinking coffee, studying, exercising, and normal resting state) on heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Data will be collected through individual measurements and analyzed accordingly.



### 1. Normal State → Stable Heart Rate and Oxygen Levels
- **Source:** Resting state without physical or mental activity.
- **Purpose:** The heart rate is expected to be at its lowest and most stable, while the blood oxygen level remains constant.

### 2. Drinking Coffee → Increased Heart Rate
- **Source:** Caffeine consumption.
- **Purpose:** The stimulant effects of caffeine may cause a short-term increase in heart rate. The impact on oxygen levels will be analyzed.

### 3. Studying → Stress-Induced Changes
- **Source:** Activities requiring concentration.
- **Purpose:** It is expected that attention and stress may increase heart rate. The effect on oxygen levels will also be examined.

### 4. Exercising → Increased Heart Rate and Oxygen Consumption
- **Source:** Physical activities such as walking or using workout equipment.
- **Purpose:** Physical activity naturally increases heart rate and oxygen consumption. The trend of these changes will be analyzed.

## Data Collection and Analysis
- Data will be collected from **Apple Health**, recorded by **Apple Watch**.
- Health data will be exported from Apple Health and used for analysis.
- Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`) will be used for data analysis.
- Correlation analysis will be conducted to examine relationships, and results will be visualized.

## GitHub Tasks
- [ ] Create a project repository.
- [ ] Plan the data collection process.
- [ ] Collect and analyze the first dataset.
- [ ] Share the results in a report.

This project will provide valuable insights into individual physiological responses and serve as a data analysis example that can be shared with the community.
