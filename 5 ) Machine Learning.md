# NBA Basketball Analytics: Assist/Turnover Ratio Machine Learning Analysis

## üìä Machine Learning Overview

This project already investigated the relationship between **Assist/Turnover Ratio (AST/TO)** and two key basketball performance metrics and proved or disproved some relationships considering these two metrics:
- **Points Per Game (PPG)** - Offensive output
- **Win Percentage** - Overall team success

Using machine learning techniques on NBA regular season data from 2000-2023 and NBA playoff data from 2000-2021 , we aim to understand how ball movement efficiency translates to scoring and winning.

## üéØ Research Questions for Machine Learning 

1. **Primary Question**: How strongly does AST/TO ratio predict a team's points per game thorugh a season?
2. **Secondary Question**: Can AST/TO ratio be used to predict win percentage of the team?
3. **Exploratory Question**: What other factors might explain the variance not captured by AST/TO ratio ( e.g some different offansive or defensive metrics)?

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Methodology

### Model 1: AST/TO Ratio ‚Üí Points Per Game (PPG)

#### Algorithm Selection
We implemented **Linear Regression** as our primary model due to:
- Clear interpretability of coefficients
- Established linear relationship hypothesis
- Baseline for comparison with complex models

#### Model Architecture
```
Input: AST/TO Ratio (X)
Output: Points Per Game (y)
Model: y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅX + Œµ
```

#### Hyperparameters
- **Regularization**: None (OLS)
- **Solver**: Normal equation
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV for model validation

### Model 2: AST/TO Ratio ‚Üí Win Percentage

#### Similar linear regression approach with win percentage as target variable

## üìä Results & Performance Metrics

### Model 1: Points Per Game Prediction

#### ‚úÖ Strong Performance Indicators
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **R¬≤ Score** | 0.33 | AST/TO explains 33% of PPG variance |
| **Coefficient** | +2305.33 | Points increase per season per AST/TO unit |
| **Intercept** | 4583.19 | Baseline points when AST/TO = 0 |
| **P-value** | < 0.001 | Statistically significant |

#### Key Insights
- **Practical Impact**: 1.0 increase in AST/TO ratio predicts ~28 additional points per game (2305/82 games)
- **Effect Size**: Medium to large correlation (r ‚âà 0.57)
- **Statistical Significance**: Highly significant relationship (p < 0.001)

### Model 2: Win Percentage Prediction

#### ‚ùå Weak Performance Indicators
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **R¬≤ Score** | 0.08 | AST/TO explains only 8% of win variance ||
| **Coefficient** | +0.089 | Weak positive relationship |
| **P-value** | 0.023 | Marginally significant |

#### Key Insights
- **Limited Predictive Power**: AST/TO alone is insufficient for predicting wins
- **Complex Relationship**: Winning requires multiple factors beyond ball movement
- **Non-linear Patterns**: May require more sophisticated modeling approaches

### Correlation Analysis
```
Correlation Matrix:
                AST/TO    PTS/GAME    WIN_PCT
AST/TO          1.000      0.574      0.283

2. **AST/TO ‚Üí WIN_PCT**: Weak positive correlation (r = 0.283)  
3. **PTS/GAME ‚Üí WIN_PCT**: Moderate correlation (r = 0.421)

### Residual Analysis
- **Homoscedasticity**: Residuals show constant variance
- **Normality**: Residuals approximately normal (Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.12)
- **Independence**: No significant autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson = 1.97)

## üí° Business Insights & Implications

### For Points Per Game (Strong Relationship)
- **Coaching Strategy**: Emphasize ball movement and turnover reduction
- **Player Evaluation**: Prioritize point guards with high AST/TO ratios  
- **Team Building**: Invest in players who create assists without turnovers

### For Win Percentage (Weak Relationship)
- **Holistic Approach**: Winning requires more than just ball movement
- **Defense Matters**: Defensive efficiency likely more predictive of wins
- **Clutch Performance**: Late-game execution may be more critical

## üéØ Conclusions

### Key Findings Summary

#### ‚úÖ Successful Predictions
- **AST/TO ‚Üí Points Per Game**: Strong, interpretable relationship (R¬≤ = 0.33)
- **Practical Significance**: Teams improving AST/TO by 0.2 can expect ~6 more points per game
- **Statistical Robustness**: Highly significant relationship across 23 seasons

#### ‚ùå Challenging Predictions

#### For Future Research
1. **Multi-dimensional Modeling**: Include defensive and situational metrics
2. **Player-Level Analysis**: Individual AST/TO impact on team success
3. **Temporal Analysis**: How AST/TO importance has evolved over eras
